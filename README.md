# Covid-Managment-Web-System

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based system designed to help companies manage their employees' COVID-19 information. The system allows administrators to track and update the vaccination status and COVID-19 test results of employees. If an employee tests positive for COVID-19, the system can update their status and mark them for remote work. Administrators can also view reports showing how many employees are vaccinated, how many are working from home, and other relevant COVID-19-related information.

The system was developed for educational purposes using **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP**, and **SQL**.
